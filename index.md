## About me

Hello I'm Justin a 3rd year computer science major studying computer science. This quarter I am enrolled in CSE 110. You can contact me through <juw008@ucsd.edu>

## Academic Information

- Outside I really like to learn more about *blockchain* and looking for small projects. The topic and new emergance of it is very interesting and I am greatful to be in this new age.

- My favorite programming language is SQL and used a bit in managing small data. Very helpful in creating lists and entries for organizing entries.

- One of the clubs that I enjoy partaking in is Sixth Tech Comm. We look to host Winter GameFest every year. While it has been difficult with the online transition, but hope that this year would be a lot smoother. Look forward to WGF 2021/2022 this winter!
